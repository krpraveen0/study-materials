# typeof operator

The typeof operator accepts one operand and returns a string which describes the type of an object.

```jsx
typeof ''  //"string"
typeof 0 //"number"
typeof true //"boolean"
typeof {} //"object"
typeof [] //"object"
typeof null //"object"
typeof undefined //"undefined"
typeof Symbol() //"symbol"
```

example:

```jsx
log = console.log;
log(typeof '');
log(typeof 0);
log(typeof true);
log(typeof {});
log(typeof []);
log(typeof null);
log(typeof undefined);
log(typeof Symbol());
```

output

```jsx
string
function.js:3 number
function.js:4 boolean
function.js:5 object
function.js:6 object
function.js:7 object
function.js:8 undefined
function.js:9 symbol
```

What is the difference between array, object & null

In the above example there is a problem that arrays,objects and the null value have the same type.

so as a developer it would be really helpful if we could differentiate between them.

The above problem has been solved by the ES6

What if we will try to use type of operator on function?

The typeof operator returns function only . Any function is of type function only.
