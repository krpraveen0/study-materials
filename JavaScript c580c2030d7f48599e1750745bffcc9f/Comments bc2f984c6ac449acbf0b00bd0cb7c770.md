# Comments

In javascript we comment the code by using ( /* and */ ) everything between the /* * and */ is going to be ignored by the interpreter.

In Js we have two ways to comment the code

1. single line comment - It can be acheived by using // symbol . 

The interpreter ignores the line which starts with //

1. multi line comment - We can comment multiple lines of code by using /* and */

The interpreter is going to ignore everything inside the /* and */ .

```jsx
//program to add two number
/*
var a = 10 
var b = 20 
var sum = a + b
*/
console.log("the sum of a and b is:", sum);
```
