# Destructuring

It is a process of extracting data from  arrays or  objects without manually creating the variables.

```jsx
let person = {
    name : "Ujjwal",
    age: 80,
    location: "orissa"
}

//destructring syntax 
let { age: personAge} = person;
console.log(personAge);
```

In the above code destructuring expression in the left hand side value is the key from the object, and the right hand side is the new variable we would like to create.

Clearly we can see that in above code we are making use of new variable to avoid this we can use a short hand method to extract the values of different properties as given below:

 

```jsx
let person = {
    name : "Ujjwal",
    age: 80,
    location: "orissa"
}

// //destructring
// let { age: personAge} = person;
// console.log(personAge);

let { age } = person
console.log(age)
```

The great thing about the destructuring is we can extract the values of multiple keys of an object as well. ie

```jsx
let person = {
    name : "Ujjwal",
    age: 80,
    location: "orissa"
}

// //destructring
// let { age: personAge} = person;
// console.log(personAge);

let { age, location: currentLocation } = person
console.log(age)
console.log(currentLocation)
```

One thing to note in above code is we have used mix and match the shorthand with longer assignment. If we had done this with just the shorthand location key as the variable name, there would be an issue!, Since location refers to the window.location property which is already defined by the browser, so changing the location is going to change the location of our web page, that’s to avoid that we have used a new variable name.

We can even use computed properties(like we were using in the objects concept) to pull out the values.

```jsx
let key = 'age'
let {[key]: keyAge} = person;
console.log(keyAge)
```

In the above case we have a string value stored on our variable, and this will now act as our key.

Along with objects we can also destructure arrays. 

In arrays instead of being able to extract the values based on the keys from an object, we can just use variables that represents elements in the array.

```python
let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
let [first,second] = numbers
console.log(first,second)
```

Unlike destructuring an object, we can’t just use the key name to select any element in the array.

Luckily we have the ability to skip elements in the array as shown below code

```python
let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
// let [first,second] = numbers
// console.log(first,second)
let [first,second,,fourth] = numbers
console.log(first,second,fourth)//1 2 4
```

Destructuring is a pretty common practice when pulling from a module, we will be seeing more on it in later classes. But we are to learn React where we are going to see how destructuring is going to be used in the React

```python
import React from 'react';
import ReactDom from 'react-dom';
//below we are using destructing to pull the components of the react-router module
import { React, Route, Link } from 'react-router'

let App = React.createClass({
	render(){
		return (
			<div>
				 <h1>My APP</h1>
				 <link to ="/somepage">a link</link>
			</div>

		);	
	}
})
```
