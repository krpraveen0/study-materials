# ES6

ES6 was released in the 2015. Actually it is a version of Javascript released by ECMASCRIPT.

To check the compatibility of es6 in different browsers we can visit [https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)

As a developer we need to make sure that our web application must be supported by wide range of browsers, to do so we need to take our ES6 code and **transpile** it down into some of the supported previous versions of JS like ES5 which will be readable by that browser.

What is Transpiling?

Transpiling is the act of taking one language and compiling it to another language. It is also referred to as source-to-source compiling. 

Let's see an example

```jsx
const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
const max = Math.max(..numbers);
```

In above code, we used the spread operator to expand all out the numbers array into Math.max().

The above code is not going to run in any browser that do not support ES6. However taking this and running it through a transpiler, for Babel will compile it down to something that looks as shown below:

```jsx
"use strict"
var numbers =[1,2,3,4,5]
var max = Math.max.apply(Math,numbers)
```

The above code is readable by all the browsers today. The idea of transpiling code is not new, many languages compiles from one source code to another source code.

There are many languages that use JavaScript as their compile target. One of the most popular language is CoffeeScript. This is a language that came about as a way to extend and add new functionality to JS so that we can write something like shown below:

```jsx
multi = (mult,numbers..)->
	numbers.map(n->n*multi)
```

The above code would equate to compiled JavaScript that looks like as shown below:

```jsx
var mlti,
slice = [].slice;
multi = function(){
	var mul,numbers;
	mul = arguments[0], numbers = 2 <= arguments.length ? slice.call(arguments,1) : [];
	return numbers.map(n(function(){
		return n * multi;
	}));
}
```

CoffeeScript brought some elegant new features to JS and ultimately some of those features were the inspiration for features like arrow feature in ES6.

As in order to utilize ES6 features now, we need to make sure we won't run into cross-browser compatibility issues, to achieve this we need to transpile our code.

Let's see the two possible way to transpile our code

1. npm scripts with babel
2. gulp with babel

Babel

It is the go-to transpiler for ES6.

It was originally called 6to5, but was later named to Babel as it was apparent that the name would not work moving forward. 

With the release of Babel 6, the focus turned more toward making it pluggable. It created a system that allows us to create plugins to transform our code, the default action for Babel in version 6 is not to trasform our ES6 to ES5 anymore, so now we need to include various presets.

The presets in Babel allows us either to pick and choose the transformation that we want, or we can select the babel-preset-es2015 preset and work with all the features.

Babel CLI

Before making use of Bable CLI, first thing which we need to do is install the node.js in our OS.

the easiest way to install the node.js is to visit [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) . Download it and install in your computer system.

If everything will be going fine and smooth then now we have node installed in our system. To confirm the Node.js installation, Lets open the command prompt and run the below commands

```jsx
>node -v
v16.13.0
```

The above response tells us that node version 16.3 is installed in our os.

To know more about running commands in command prompt you can refer to [https://commandlinepoweruser.com/](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/)

Now it's time to install Babel CLI. To do so we will be using a package manager from node which npm ( node package manager). To confirm that npm is installed along with the node in our os just run the below command in command prompt

```jsx
>npm -v
8.1.4
```

Now using npm we are going to create a test project folder ie

mkdir demo-project 

after that we need to navigate to that folder ie

cd demo-project

To start a project we need to create a file ie package.json which will be containing all the dependencies of our project. To create package.json we will be making use of npm  ie

```jsx
demo-project> npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (demo-project)
version: (1.0.0)
description: This is a demo project
entry point: (index.js) app.js
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author: engineeringcoders
license: (ISC)
About to write to D:\Software Training Classes\MERN-8PM\ES6\demo-project\package.json:

{
  "name": "demo-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is a demo project",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "engineeringcoders",
  "license": "ISC"
}

Is this OK? (yes)
```

The above command creates package.json file which contains information about our project. ie 

![package.PNG](ES6%20f642ff75858e47b6aa3542696e944cd3/package.png)

in above package.json we have specified entry point to our project as app.js which will be main file of our project.

Now let's install babel package by running the follwing command

```jsx
npm install --save-dev babel-cli
```

After running the above line we will see few changes in our project directory.

First we will notice that there is now a node_modules folder, and second that there is a new entry inside our package.json file. There is one key part to the code above: the â€”save-dev flag. This flag will save the module, babel-cli, in our package.json file under devDependencies section. as shown below

```jsx
"devDependencies": {
    "babel-cli": "^6.26.0"
  }
```

The above section in the file is used for modules that will be used in development meaning they are not needed in production. If we had run our install with â€”save instead, it would put the module under the dependencies section as shown below

```jsx
"dependencies": {
    "babel-cli": "^6.26.0"
  }
```

but, what is the point of all these section? If you are unfamiliar with npm and the package.json file, it's a file that we can take from project to project and run npm install and anything listed in devDependencies or dependencies will be installed for that project. If we want to install just the dependencies we would have run 

```jsx
npm install --production
```

There will be cases when we are developing our apps that we will want to use certain modules exclusively for development, and certain modules exclusively for production.

Using â€”save and â€”save-dev , we can put those modules in the right buckets.

Bable Presets

As mentioned earlier Babel doesn't default used for transpiling ES6, we need to include babel-preset-es2015 module as well to achieve that.

```jsx
npm i --save-dev babel-preset-es2015
npm WARN deprecated babel-preset-es2015@6.24.1: ðŸ™Œ  Thanks for using Babel: we recommend using babel-preset-env now: please read 
https://babeljs.io/env to update!

added 40 packages, and audited 278 packages in 5s
```

The above module ensures that we have the ability to transpile our code.

Folder Structure of the project

```jsx
-<project-folder>
	-<src>
			-app.js
	-<public>
	-package.json
```

In the root project-folder We have src folder and a public folder.

The src folder is used to hold our pre-transpiled-code. This would be the code that is written with the nice ES6 syntax.

The public folder will be the destination for our transpiled code. The public folder would also hold the CSS,HTML and images that our app requires.

1. Using NPM Script with babel to transpile the code

In package.json file there is a section called scripts where we can define commands we would like to run. Using the Babel CLI we can set up a script to compile our code and output it where we would like. 

The scripts section takes a JSON object as a value. The keys in this object will be the name of our script and the value will the command to run.

```jsx
"scripts": {
    "transpile":"babel src/app.js --out-file public/app.js"
  }
```

Adding the above code to our package.json in the scripts section will take our code from src/app.js, run it through Babel, and output the file in public/app.js.

The Babel command has many options to it that we will look at later, but the 

â€”out-file flag is used to determine the destination of the compiled source.

Example:

```jsx
const person = {
    name : 'Ujjwal'
};

//template literal of es6
const testString = `My name is ${person.name}`;
```

1. transpiling by using Gulp and babel

Gulp

Gulp is a popular task runner that helps to automate our workflow. There are a ton of different task runners out there, including Grunt, Broccoli And Brunch.

Here we are going to see how to configure Gulp to automate working with Babel, and later we will use this to work with modules as well

In order to start with Gulp we need to install in globally on our system. Gulp is another npm module, so we need to install it like

```html
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

We need to install gulp one globally and also locally in each new project. 

How we can install gulp locally for each new project

```html
npm install --save-dev gulp
```

To configure gulp we must first create a new file called gulpfile.js which will be used to define our task. If you have never worked with node.js before, you might not be familiar with the require function. This function is used to pull any modules from the node_modules folde, or own modules.

as we have installed gulp so the gulp module is going to reside in out node_modules folder.

In gulpfile.js we can get access to gulp by requiring it as shown below

```jsx
//importing the gulp
const gulp = require('gulp')
```

The above syntax is going to store the gulp in a variable gulp. We can notice that we  have used const here!. This gulpfile.js will be our first JavaScript file that uses ES6. We will not be going to discuss the ES6 rules in deep here as Gulp is all about tasks. So we will start by defining some simple tasks in this file. 

```jsx
//importing the gulp
const gulp = require('gulp')
//task1
gulp.task('js',()=>{

});
//task2
gulp.task('default',()=>{

});
```

In above code () â‡’ is the syntax for arrow function.  The above file has two tasks and they will work together, and also separately if we would like. 

The first of the task is one we will call js (note that we can call task anything  we want  with exception of default). The js task will deal with taking our JS and running it through Babel. 

In order to run this task we can run gulp js in our terminal as shown below:

```jsx
gulp js
[20:34:10] Using gulpfile D:\Software Training Classes\MERN-8PM\ES6\demo-project\gulpfile.js
[20:34:10] Starting 'js'...
[20:34:10] The following tasks did not complete: js
[20:34:10] Did you forget to signal async completion?
```

As we haven't defined our task yet so we are getting this. 

The second task is called default. This is a special task, in which we can setup code that will kick off many other tasks, or in our case creates a listener for when certain file changes. To run this task we can simply type gulp in the terminal as shown below

```jsx
gulp
[20:37:02] Using gulpfile D:\Software Training Classes\MERN-8PM\ES6\demo-project\gulpfile.js
[20:37:02] Starting 'default'...
[20:37:02] The following tasks did not complete: default
[20:37:02] Did you forget to signal async completion?
```

Before we start using gulp completely we have to install a module that will allow babel to work with gulp. Oddly enough this module is called gulp-babel. To install it  type in terminal 

```jsx
npm install --save-dev gulp-babel

added 51 packages, and audited 595 packages in 10s

11 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

12 vulnerabilities (2 low, 10 high)

To address issues that do not require attention, run:
  npm audit fix

To address all issues possible (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Some issues need review, and may require choosing
a different dependency.
```

After that we will define our first job as shown below

```jsx
//importing the gulp
const gulp = require('gulp')
const babel = require('gulp-babel')
//task1
gulp.task('js',()=>{
    return gulp.src('./src/app.js')
    .pipe(babel({
        presets:['2015']
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./public'))
});
//task2
gulp.task('default',()=>{

});
```

The first thing we need to do is require gulp-babel, then in our js task we return gulp.src('./src/app.js'). We return this to let gulp know that this will be an asynchronous event.

The .src method lets us set the path for our file, and in this case it is a single ie app.js.

When we get to the modules portion that time we will learn more about it.

Gulp works with streams, meaning that we can keep moving the data down the pipe, so we are using .pip method we take the source files and send them through babel.

Just like earlier, we need to specify the presets we want to use. To do this we can pass an object to the babel function to tell the babel plugin which preset we would like to use. 

Our source get transformed into the browser-ready code and it gets passed along again, so that we can pipe it into gulp.dest() method, which sets the final destination for our source file.

Now as we have defined our js task, running gulp js in the terminal should produce output

**Numbers and Math in ES6**

In ES6 there are a bunch of additions to Numbers and the Math object. There
are new Number literals, Binary and Octal, as well a ton of new methods for
Math .

**Binary Literals**

In ES6 we have the ability to create binary literals. In order to do this we need
to prefix our binary number with 0b or 0B .

Example:

```jsx
console.log(0b001) // The number 1
console.log(0b010) // The number 2
console.log(0b011) // The number 3
console.log(0b100) // The number 4
```

If you have never worked with binary numbers before, the pattern goes like
this: Starting for the right to the left, the smallest number is as far right as
possible. For example 0001 in binary is 1 .

If we wanted to get the numbers 3 it would be 0011 , adding 2 and 1 .

Letâ€™s do one more, how about 10 ? Well that would be 1010 or 8 + 2 .

*Math with binary numbers*

We can perform mathematical operations with the binary numbers just like
we normally would.

```jsx
console.log(0b100 + 0b010)
```

Can you guess what that adds up too? Well 6 of course, the neat thing is we
can add binary and integer numbers together as well as shown below

```jsx
console.log(0b110 + 9)
```

The above code is going to produce 15.

**Octal Literals**

Just like binary literals we are able to create octal literals as well. Octal
numbers are a base 8 number system, binary is a base 2 system. In Octal
numbers each place is a multiple of 8, and the number present in that place
will be used to determine the value. Letâ€™s look at some examples

Like the binary literals we use 0o or 0O to denote it what number type it will
be, so 0o0001 will be the number 1 .

So if we had 0o0020 this would be 16 , as it takes the multiple in that place and
times it by 2 .

**Math with octal numbers**

Just like the binary literal, octals can be used to preform mathematical
operations on with mixed number types.

```jsx
console.log(0o0020 + 7) // 23
```

We can even mix it with binary numbers.

```jsx
console.log(0o0010 + 0b0111) // 15
```

**Math Module**

In ES6 there are a ton of new Math methods. These include 

```jsx
Math.clz32 ,
Math.imul , Math.sign , Math.log10 , Math.log2 , Math.log1p , Math.expm1 ,
Math.cosh , Math.sinh , Math.tanh , Math.acosh , Math.asinh , Math.atanh ,
Math.trunc , Math.fround , Math.cbrt , Math.hypot
```

 â€¦woof that is a lot! A lot of the additions here are for Trigonometry.

We wonâ€™t look at all of these, but I would like to show you one method, that is
**Math.trunc** .

**Math.trunc:**

The .trunc() method is used to truncate the number provided to it, for
example:

```jsx
console.log(Math.trunc(5.6) )//5
console.log(Math.trunc(9.231)) //9
```

It is used to just cut off the numbers after the decimal, this differs from
Math.floor , Math.ceil and Math.round in that it just cuts them off, it does not
perform any rounding on the number. 

**Strings, Regex & Unicode**

*String Methods*

Recently introduced in JavaScript are a few string methods that are more
convenient methods for working with strings. These methods include
.startsWith , .endsWidth , .includes , and .repeat .
Previously if we wanted to search for the existence of some text in a string we
would have to use regex. Now there are a few methods that help us make this
a bit easier.

**.startsWith**
If you wanted to see if a string started with a specific bit of text, we could have
created a regular expression that looked like this.

```jsx
const truth = "JavaScript is a really fun language!";
console.log(truth.match(/^JavaScript/)); //[ 'JavaScript',index: 0,
 //input: 'JavaScript is a really fun language!' ]
console.log(truth.match(/^fun/)); //null
```

The above regular expression would search for the work JavaScript at the
beginning of our string. With the .startsWith method, we cause do that same
thing.

```jsx
const truth = "JavaScript is a really fun language!";
console.log(truth.startsWith("JavaScript")); //true
console.log(truth.startsWith("fun")); //false
```

The method will return true or false if the text you are looking for appears
in the at the start of the string.

**.endsWith**

Similar to .startsWith the .endsWith method will check to see if a string ends
with a specific bit of text. If we wanted to do this in with a regular expression
we could match it like this.

```jsx
const truth = "JavaScript is a really fun language!";
console.log(truth.match(/language!$/)); //['language!', index: 27 ....]
console.log(truth.match(/JavaScript$/)); //null
```

With the .endsWith method will allow us to make this check without having to
write any regex, and it will simply return true or false after the check.

```jsx
const truth = "JavaScript is a really fun language!";
console.log(truth.endsWith('language!')); //true
console.log(truth.endsWith('JavaScript')); //false
```

**.includes**

If we can check weather a string starts or ends with some text we should also
be able to check if it includes some text. The .includes method will allow us
to do just this. This is again another convenience method for something we
could perform with a regular expression.

```jsx
const truth = "JavaScript is a really fun language!";
console.log(truth.match(/fun/g)); //["fun"]
console.log(truth.match(/a/g)); //["a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "a"]const truth = "JavaScript is a really fun language!";
console.log(truth.match(/fun/g)); //["fun"]
console.log(truth.match(/a/g)); //["a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "a"]
```

The .includes method checks the entire string for the provided text, note the
check **is case sensitive**!

```jsx
const truth = "JavaScript is a really fun language!";
console.log(truth.includes('fun')); //true
console.log(truth.includes('a',10)); //true
console.log(truth.includes('go')); //false
```

Just like .startsWith and .endsWith the .includes method will return true
or false .

NOte: 

Unlike the other methods, .includes takes a second optional position
parameter called **start position**. This is used to tell .includes about where it should start checking
in the string for the value.

.repeat()

this .repeat() method is pretty straight forward, it allows us to repeat a string a given number of times.

```jsx
const js = 'JS'.repeat(3)
console.log('JS repeats itself ' + js) //JS repeats itself JSJSJS
```

Note: There are few exceptions to what we can pass in as the count. 

It can not be negative number and if we pass any decimal number then it will be rounded to an integer.

```jsx
const js = 'JS'.repeat(-3)
console.log('JS repeats itself ' + js)
```

```jsx
numbers.js:21 Uncaught RangeError: Invalid count value
    at String.repeat (<anonymous>)
    at VM220 numbers.js:21
```

**Unicode**
It is introduced in ES6 that Unicode is the ability to represent Unicode as code points.

Previously this was not possible because we could only represent unicode character with up to 4 hexadecimal digits. So any Unicode character that required more than 4, we need to create a surrogate pair.

However in ES6 we can use **\u{} syntax to include up to 6 digits, enough to represent all the unicode characters.**

```jsx
console.log('\u{1F44D}')
```
